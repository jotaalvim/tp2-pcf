# How to use :
- ``ghci Adventurers.hs``
- possible to all be on other side in 17 minutes ? : ``leq17``
- possible to all be other side in less than 17 minutes ? : ``l17``
- show the solutions paths that takes 17 minutes : ``fastest``
- show the number of solutions that have less than x crossings : ``solutionsC x`` (example: ``solutionsC 9``)
- show the number of solutions that have less than x crossings and less than y minutes : ``solutionsCT x y`` (example: ``solutionsCT 9 30``)
